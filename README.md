# Intro
This is a command line interface version of Conway's game of life

# Build instructions
As this repository has a makefile, the only thing you need to do is type: `make` to build the project. The executable should be in the build directory labeled `cwgol`

Alternatively, you can type `make install` to install the program to your system, then type `cwgoll` to start the game! (You may need to run this as sudo)

# Removing the game
Typing `make clean` will remove the project
